## JSX - Babel

- JSX -> React.createElement -> JS Object -> createRoot() -> HTML Element
- Babel transpiles JSX into React.CreateElement
- JSX is not HTML
- Babel transforms ES6 features and converts them to be compatible for older browsers
- Babel - also called as JS compiler and transpiler
- why JSX is not HTML - ex.<h1 className="heading"></h1> - className is not HTML
- Function that returns JSX/React element is Functional Component
- Why JSX - easier to read & sanitizes the data - no XSS
